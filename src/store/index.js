// Redux Middleware
//
//
// Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.
//
//     Middleware is a function that takes an action and either dispatches another action or does nothing.
//
//     It is a way to extend Redux with custom functionality.
//
//     It lets you wrap the storeâ€™s dispatch method for fun and profit.
//
//     It is a way to intercept and act on actions that have been dispatched to the store.
//
//     It is a way to do asynchronous actions like AJAX calls.
//
//     It is a way to do logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.
